
BELOW ARE THE 3 FIGURES FOR GOOD INTERPRETATION OF DATA.


CORRELATION HEATMAP: (GOOD)

WE CAN IDENTIFY AT A GLANCE STRONG POSITIVE & NEGATIVE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT COLUMNS.
EG 1: S3 & S4 HAVE STRONG NEGATIVE CORRELATION.
EG 2: S4 & S2 HAVE STRONG POSITIVE CORRELATION.
EG 2: BMI & Y HAVE STRONG POSITIVE CORRELATION.

BOXPLOT AGE_CAT (AGE CATEGORY) AGAINST EVERY OTHER COLUMN: (BETTER)

THIS GRAPH PLOTS AGE CATEGORY 19-30, 30-40, 40-50 ETC. AGAINST AVERAGE OF EACH OTHER COLUMN.
THIS SHOWS THE TREND OF EACH COLUMN DEPENDING ON THE AGE.
EG 1: AVERAGE BP INCREASES GRADUALLY BETWEEN 19 TO 70 YEARS. AFTER 70 THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT FALL IN BP.
EG 2: AVERAGE S4 INCREASES BETWEEN 19-30 & 31-40. THEN REMAINS ALMOST CONSTANT TILL 70. S4 INCREASES DRASTICALLY AFTER 70. 


SWARMPLOT & BOXPLOT AGE_CAT (AGE CATEGORY) AGAINST AVERAGE OF EVERY OTHER COLUMN: (BEST)

WE CAN SEE THE DISTRIBUTION OF ALL COLUMNS ACCORDING TO AGE CATERGORY. WE CAN SEE THE EXACT DATA POINTS AS WELL IN THE SWARM PLOT. 
EG 1: AGE CATEGORY VS BP. WE CAN SEE THAT BP INCREASES AS THE AGE INCREASES. ALSO THERE IS MORE VARIATION IN BP AS THE AGE INCREASES. (CONSIDERING DATA POINT BETWEEN 1ST & 3RD QUARTILE)
EG 2: S3 IS THE ONLY COLUMN WHERE THE AVERAGE REDUCES OVER THE AGE. THERE IS A DRASTIC FALL AFTER 7O YEARS OF AGE.
